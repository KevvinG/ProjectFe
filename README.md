## Install Project CocoaPod Dependencies

Once you see the project folder, navigate to: /fe/Fe/
Inside this folder ou should see Fe, Fe-Mini, Fe-Mini Extension etc. Run the command below:
1. pod install

This command may take some time to install all the dependencies.

---

## Open the Project

After running the pod install command, double-click the Fe.xcworkspace file and it should open the project in Xcode for you.
Once opened, you may need to change the Team Signing to your own for it to work.

Click the "Fe" base file > Signing & Capabilities.

**NOTE If you have to change the bundle identifiers, Notifications will not work because they are tied to our project bundle identifier.

Change the team (and potentially the bundle identifier) for each of the targets found in the left-side bar.
You may also need to change the bundle identifier in the folder structure on the left: Fe-Mini > Info.plist at the bottom.
You may also need to change the bundle identifier in the folder structure on the left: Fe-Mini Extension > Info.plist at the bottom.

After this, you should be able to build the project and run it.
